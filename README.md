# pyab
An experimentation library in order to conduct analysis after an experiment. There is no randomisation/splitting logic code included but only the analysis part considering: 
   "fixed horizon" experiments which follow the frequentist approach and
   "bayesian" experiments 
With regards to the metrics, I have taken into account proportions/ratio metrics and cumulative figures. Proportions include metrics such as "pick-up ratio" and cumulative have to do with any revenue metric (not unitary). Normally the first category has to do predominantly with "Marketplace Ops" while the latter touches mostly "Growth" experiments
